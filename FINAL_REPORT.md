  - *Note: Server startup may take a minute.*  
- **Reflections:**  
  - **Pros:** Provides a live, accessible version of our application at no cost.
  - **Cons:** Slow initial server startup.


## Programming Languages and Frameworks


### HTML
- **Reflections:**  
  - **Pros:** Fundamental for structuring web content, which made it indispensable for creating the basic layout and structure of our web application. Its straightforward syntax was easy to learn and apply. Having a base.html with its structure proved to be a super valuable idea. Being this is the most popular for web apps, using it was super important.
  - **Cons:** We quickly realized that HTML alone couldn't handle user interactions or any dynamic behavior in the web application, making it necessary to integrate JavaScript for those functionalities.


### CSS
- **Reflections:**  
  - **Pros:** Provided powerful control over the visual appearance of our web application, allowing us to create a visually engaging user interface. This being one of the most popular styling apps it had lots of tools and resources to to learn and navigate.
  - **Cons:** Managing CSS across a large project proved to be a fun challenge. We faced issues like style conflicts and difficulties in maintaining a consistent look and feel throughout the app, especially as our CSS files grew in complexity. Using the base.html file really helped solve this problem. 


### JavaScript
- **Reflections:**  
  - **Pros:** Enabled us to add interactive elements to our web pages, which was crucial for enhancing the user experience. 
  - **Cons:** Since we were more focused on functionality we didn't get the chance to use all the exciting features it offered.


### Python
- **Reflections:**  
  - **Pros:** Its syntax is clear and concise, which made it easier for us as beginners to write backend code effectively. Since we have already been using it in class this made things more efficient. We appreciated Python's vast standard library and third-party modules that greatly extended our project's capabilities. There were lots of easy resources for us to integrate. (Ex. Password Hashing)
  - **Cons:** No significant cons, mainly just lack of experience and knowledge but this allowed for the learning process to occur. 


### Flask
- **Reflections:**  
  - **Pros:** Flaskâ€™s minimalistic and modular design was perfect for getting our web application off the ground quickly. It was easy to set up and integrate with other technologies, which was ideal for our learning curve.
  - **Cons:** No significant cons to Flask either. 


### Jinja
- **Reflections:**  
  - **Pros:** Jinja made it straightforward to generate HTML from templates, which we found to be an easy way to display some of our dynamic content pulled from our backend.
  - **Cons:** We struggled with organizing templates to reuse code efficiently, which was crucial as our project expanded.


## Code Editors


### Visual Studio Code
- **Reflections:**  
  - **Pros:** Comprehensive features support development processes extensively. 
  - **Cons:** Can be resource-intensive, affecting system performance. Larger Learning curve. 


### Brackets
- **Reflections:**  
  - **Pros:** Streamlined for web development, lightweight.
  - **Cons:** Fewer plugins compared to more comprehensive editors like Visual Studio Code.


## Final Status Report


### Completed Work
- **Features Implemented:**
  - User Login/Logout Functionality: Secure user registration and session management.
  - Recipe Management: Users can create, save, and manage recipes.
  - Recipe Search Functionality: Extensive search capabilities by various criteria.


### In The Middle Of Implementing
- **Features In Progress:**
  - Community/Social Media: Developing a platform for user interaction and content sharing about cooking experiences. Currently the Posts are not saving to the database.


### Plans for the Future
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Media Features: Incorporating multimedia into recipes and profiles like pictures and videos.
  - Database Expansion: Enlarging the recipe database to offer more variety.


### Known Issues
- **Current Challenges:**
  - Login Clarity: There is no feedback for failed login attempts, which can confuse users. Planned improvements include explicit error messaging.
  - Recipe Ingredients and Directions formatting: Currently you need to add a period to create a new line for ingredients or steps in the directions. Also the recipe display page format needs to be updated to flow nicer and be more user friendly.


## Team Reflection

### Culture
- **Successes:**
  - **Open Communication and Collaboration:** Our team's commitment to open communication really enhanced our collaborative efforts. By holding weekly meetings, we were able to continue working though our tasks effectively and make substantial progress. This regular interaction not only kept everyone aligned but also fostered a supportive atmosphere.
  - **Flexibility and Support:** Given our full-time job commitments, our flexibility with scheduling made setting meeting times less difficult. Team members showed great understanding and adaptability, rescheduling meetings or start times happened seamlessly without impacting project momentum.
  - **Collective Learning and Participation:** We emphasized collective participation in all project facets, which help our learning experience not just on the project but also in the class.


- **Difficulties:**
  - **Role Definition and Technical Skills:** Our limited experience in software development and project management initially made it challenging to assign clear roles. This sometimes led to inefficiencies as we navigated through the technical aspects of the project. 


### Project Workflow
- **Approach and Reflections:**
  - As our skills developed through the course each team member wanted to be a part of the different aspects of the project at various stages. This distributed approach allowed us to develop a broad range of skills, from front-end design to back-end integration. Instead of assigning roles we simply worked on pieces of each aspect with some team members taking on larger portions at different times.
  - A significant challenge was the overlap in tasks, as all team members were keen to be involved in every aspect of the project. This enthusiasm, while beneficial for learning, sometimes led to redundancy and integration issues. For example, multiple team members would sometimes inadvertently work on the same functionalities without realizing it, leading to duplicated efforts and conflicts in code integration.
  - Working on all aspects meant that we often spent extra time learning about areas in the code that were not our primary responsibility. While this was enriching, in a real-world scenario it could have been more efficient to specialize.

This report encapsulates the concerted effort and collective journey of Team 3 in developing the RecipEASY application. It highlights our achievements, ongoing work, and future directions, alongside reflections on the tools and technologies that shaped our development process.
