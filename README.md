# Project Title: RecipEASY

## Team 3

Team members:

Jessica Carpenter, jeha6343, jeha6343@colorado.edu

### Weekly Meeting: Thursdays at 7pm MST 

## Vision statement: 
Provide busy customers with easy to access recipes using ingredients they have at home.

## Motivation: 
We all love to cook and this would be a product we would love to use ourselves!

## Risks to project completion, possibly including:
New language or working environment<br>
No prior experience working with these team members<br>
Lack of front and backend experience, git experience, SQL experience or building applications<br>
Teammates in different time zones<br>
Scope creep<br>
Due to a lack of experience building applications, there is a risk of missing user stories and falling behind in completing tasks.

### Mitigation Strategy for the above risks
Don't bite off more than we can chew<br>
Using available and outside resources to help determine timelines <br>
Allocate time for research to help with sizing user stories<br>
Overall: be realistic with sizing stories and requirements<br>
Maintain regular communication with teammates<br>
Potential to implement demos<br>
Teammates switching roles to avoid silos or not knowing pieces of the project<br>

## Development method: (need more specifics)
Scrum method and jira for the tracking software<br>
Will use discord for team coordination and communication.<br>
